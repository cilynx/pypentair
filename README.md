# Yet Another Python Pool Controller

There are already several projects similar to this one that are further down the road, but I wanted to play with object oriented Python, RS-485 packet munging, and TDD, hence, yet another...

This project has 2 overarching goals:
* Code should be self-documenting and as transparent as possible -- anyone should be able to read and understand exactly how it works
* Actually manage the pool -- at least the pump and solar heater
